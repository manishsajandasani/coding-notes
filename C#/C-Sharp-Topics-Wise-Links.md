# C# Basics

## What is C#

- C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".
- It is a general-purpose, modern and strongly typed object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg that runs on the .NET Framework.
- C# is open source, simple, modern, flexible, and versatile.
- C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.
- The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 11, was released in November 2022.
- Approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
- C# is designed for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure). CLI is a specification that describes executable code and runtime environment.
- C# is Versatile and used for:
    - Windows client applications
    - Windows libraries and components
    - Windows services
    - Web applications
    - Web services and Web API
    - Native iOS and Android mobile apps
    - Backend services
    - Azure cloud applications and services
    - Backend database using ML/Data tools
    - Interoperability software such as Office, SharePoint, SQL Server and so on.
    - Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning
    - Blockchains and distributed ledger technology including cryptocurrency
    - Internet of Things (IoT) devices
    - Gaming consoles and gaming systems
    - Video games

## Why C#

- It is Modern, Fast and Open Source, Cross Platform, Safe & Efficient, Versatile, Evolving in nature
- C# language was designed for businesses to build all kinds of software by using one single programming language.
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It has a huge community support.
- C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.
- Widely used for developing Games, Desktop and Web Applications.
- C# supports are generics, var types, auto initialization of types and collections, lambda expressions, dynamic programming, asynchronous programming, tuples, pattern matching, advanced debugging and exception handling, and more.
- Key concepts in C# that helps write safe and efficient code.
    - Unsafe type casting is not allowed.
    - Nullable and non-nullable types are supported in C#.
    - Declare a readonly struct to express that a type is immutable and enables the compiler to save copies when using in parameters.
    - Use a ref readonly return when the return value is a struct larger than IntPtr.Size and the storage lifetime is greater than the method returning the value.
    - When the size of a readonly struct is bigger than IntPtr.Size, you should pass it as an in parameter for performance reasons.
    - Never pass a struct as an in parameter unless it's declared with the readonly modifier because it may negatively affect performance and could lead to an obscure behavior.
    - Use a ref struct, or a readonly ref struct such as Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T> to work with memory as a sequence of bytes.
